# Helyx — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft for Review
**Author:** Hasan Kagalwala (with product/architecture assist)
**Date:** 2026-07-20
**Owner:** MHZ Software

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Helyx is a multi-tenant HRIS and Leave Management SaaS. It replaces MHZ Software's current use of TalentHR's free plan, then extends into a broader HR platform (performance reviews, onboarding checklists, deeper reporting).

The MVP achieves feature parity with the TalentHR free plan for daily use: employee directory, employee profile, leave booking and approval, team calendar, company and personal documents, task/approval inbox, admin management of the tenant. It is designed from day one as a generic SaaS product: every company (tenant) is isolated by `tenant_id`, gets its own subdomain and branding, and configures its own leave policies, org units, and holiday calendar.

The stack is a modular monolith on **Java 25 + Spring Boot 4.1**, server-rendered UI (**Thymeleaf + htmx + Alpine.js + Bootstrap 5**), and **PostgreSQL 17**, deployable as a Docker container to a Debian VPS (for MHZ) or any cloud (for future customers). Development is done and maintained by a single engineer (the author), so developer productivity, familiarity, and simplicity are first-class concerns; unnecessary complexity is a design smell.

---

## 2. Product Vision

To be the HR system a small-to-mid-sized company actually enjoys using — fast, clean, honest about the rules it enforces, and configurable enough that any company can adopt it without asking us to change code. In three years, Helyx becomes the operating system for the people side of an SMB: hiring, performance, learning, and light payroll integration, all with a single sign-on, a single directory, and a single audit trail.

---

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### 3.1 Goals (MVP, ~3-4 months)

- Replace TalentHR free plan for MHZ's 8-10 person team without regression in daily use.
- Fully generic multi-tenant SaaS: onboard a new tenant with 1 SQL row + 1 admin invite, no code changes.
- Employee self-service: profile, leave booking, documents, calendar of teammates.
- Manager tooling: approve leave, see team calendar, view direct reports.
- Admin tooling: manage employees, org units (Division/Department), leave types & balances, holiday calendar, files, audit log, reports.
- Configurable leave policy per tenant with tenant-specific holidays and weekends.
- Email notifications for lifecycle events.
- Baseline security: HTTPS everywhere, tenant isolation enforced in code + DB, encryption at rest, full audit log.
- Deployable to a Debian VPS (MHZ) or any Docker-capable host in <10 minutes.

### 3.2 Goals (12-24 months)

- Onboarding/offboarding checklist templates.
- Performance reviews (goals/OKRs, 1:1s, 360 feedback).
- Public REST API + tenant API keys.
- Slack/MS Teams webhook notifications.
- Custom report builder.
- Arabic + RTL support.
- SOC2-ready controls (formal audit only when a paying customer requires it).

### 3.3 Non-Goals (explicitly out of scope for v1)

- Payroll calculation and payslip generation.
- Attendance / clock-in-out / shift management.
- Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
- Learning Management System (LMS).
- Public marketing site + self-serve billing.
- Custom domains per tenant (subdomains only in MVP).
- Native mobile app (mobile-responsive web is enough).
- Multi-currency payroll.
- Real-time chat / messaging.
- SSO (Google/Microsoft/Apple/SAML) — deferred to Phase 2/3.

## 4. Personas

**Priya — Employee (30, Software Engineer at MHZ Dubai).**
Wants to book leave in under a minute, see who's out this week, upload her renewed Emirates ID, and never think about HR software again. Uses mobile web on her phone from a cafe.

**Rahul — Manager (40, Engineering Manager, 6 direct reports).**
Approves leave, checks team's PTO balance before planning a sprint, reviews his team's calendar for the next month. Doesn't want to log in unless there's something to act on — expects email nudges.

**Aisha — HR Admin (35, People Operations Lead).**
Adds new hires, sets leave balances, uploads the employee handbook, generates a leave utilization report at end of quarter, sees the audit log if something looks off. Cares deeply about accuracy and audit-ability.

**Marco — Super Admin (Hasan / Helyx operator).**
Onboards new tenants, configures their subdomain, invites their first Admin, monitors health, resets things when they break. Not visible in the tenant's UI.

**External stakeholder — Anita, CFO of a future customer.**
Never uses the tool. Needs assurance that data is encrypted, tenant-isolated, and that termination revokes access instantly.

---

## 5. User Roles

Three fixed roles per tenant + one cross-tenant role.

| Role | Scope | Typical actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee** | Self only | View & edit own profile (limited fields), upload own documents, book/cancel own leave, view team calendar, view company files, mark own tasks done. |
| **Manager** | Self + direct reports (transitively, N levels down) | Everything an Employee does + approve/reject direct reports' leave, view reports' profiles (read-only), view reports' leave history & balances. |
| **Admin** | Entire tenant | Everything above + CRUD employees/departments/divisions/leave types/holidays/company files, view audit log, generate reports, override any leave decision, configure tenant settings, invite users. |
| **Super Admin (Helyx staff)** | All tenants | Cross-tenant. Create/suspend tenants, provision first Admin, view system health. Never appears in tenant's UI. |

An **Admin is also always an Employee** of their tenant (has a profile, can book leave). A **Manager is also an Employee**. Role escalation is additive.

Managers are derived: user X is a "manager" if any other user has `manager_id = X.id`.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | p95 page load < 400 ms for typical pages (profile, calendar, dashboard) at 50 employees × 50 tenants baseline. p95 API JSON responses < 200 ms. |
| **Availability** | 99.5% monthly (allows ~3.6 h/mo downtime) for self-hosted single-instance. Higher tiers require HA setup, not part of MVP. |
| **Scalability** | Single Spring Boot instance + single Postgres must serve baseline (50×50). Design must not preclude horizontal scale later (stateless app, no in-memory session unless via shared cache). |
| **Security** | See §19. |
| **Data integrity** | All writes transactional; leave-booking is optimistic-locked to prevent double-book of same day. |
| **Compliance readiness** | Design controls for future SOC2 Type II and GDPR compliance. No formal audit in MVP. |
| **Backup** | Daily Postgres logical backup (pg_dump) retained 30 days locally + optional off-site. Files backup follows storage backend policy (S3 versioning). |
| **Portability** | Runs on Debian 12+ VPS with Docker, or on any cloud with Docker/Kubernetes. No cloud-specific SDK dependencies. |
| **Observability** | Actuator health, Prometheus metrics endpoint, structured JSON logs to stdout. |
| **Maintainability** | Modular monolith with ArchUnit tests enforcing module boundaries. Static analysis: Checkstyle + SpotBugs + PMD in CI. |
| **Test coverage** | Unit ≥ 70% line, integration on every use-case, at least one E2E happy-path per module. |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA target. Semantic HTML, ARIA labels on interactive components, keyboard-navigable. |
| **Browser support** | Latest 2 stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Mobile Safari + Chrome on mobile. |
| **Internationalization** | All UI strings externalized (messages.properties). English only for MVP. Multi-timezone from day 1. |

## 10. Acceptance Criteria (selected — full set in test plan)

**AC-LV.1 (Book leave):**
- Given I am logged in and have a Vacation balance of 10 days
- When I click "Book time off", pick Vacation, start = Mon 2026-08-03, end = Wed 2026-08-05, no half-days, note = "trip"
- Then a leave request is created with status PENDING, duration = 3 working days, submitted to my manager
- And my displayed "future balance" for Vacation drops to 7
- And my manager receives an email within 60s

**AC-LV.2 (Weekend & holiday exclusion):**
- Given tenant weekend = Sat/Sun and public holiday Fri 2026-08-07
- When I book Mon 2026-08-03 to Mon 2026-08-10
- Then duration = 5 working days (Mon-Thu are 4 working, Fri is holiday, Sat/Sun weekend, Mon = 1 → total 5)

**AC-LV.3 (Insufficient balance):**
- Given my Vacation balance = 2 days
- When I try to book 3 days
- Then request is rejected client-side with "Insufficient balance (2 remaining, 3 requested)"
- And no leave request is persisted

**AC-LV.4 (Half day):**
- Given I book Mon start half-day AM = false, half-day PM = true, end Wed half-day AM = true
- Then duration = 2.0 (Mon full + Tue full + Wed half? actually Mon 0.5 + Tue 1 + Wed 0.5 = 2.0) — recompute per exact rule: half-day PM on start = 0.5, half-day AM on end = 0.5, middle full → 0.5+1.0+0.5 = 2.0 ✅

**AC-EMP.1 (Create employee):**
- Given I am Admin
- When I POST /employees with valid data
- Then employee is created with status = INVITED, invite email queued, no login yet
- When invitee clicks link and sets password
- Then employee status = ACTIVE and login succeeds

**AC-EMP.2 (Terminate):**
- Given employee X is Active
- When Admin sets termination_date = today
- Then X.status = TERMINATED, login blocked, active leave requests > termination_date are cancelled with note "Employee terminated"

**AC-TENANT.1 (Isolation):**
- Given tenant A has employee "Priya" and tenant B has employee "Rahul"
- When a user of tenant A queries /employees
- Then only Priya returns, and no SQL query in the audit log references tenant B

**AC-AUDIT.1 (Compensation change):**
- Given Admin edits employee compensation from 10000 to 12000
- Then audit log has entry with actor, timestamp, entity=Employee, action=UPDATE, before JSON containing {compensation:10000}, after JSON containing {compensation:12000}

**AC-CALENDAR.1 (iCal feed):**
- Given I open my Settings → Calendar integration
- When I copy the iCal URL and subscribe in Google Calendar
- Then within 24h Google Calendar shows all my APPROVED leaves as all-day events

## 11. Business Rules

**BR-1 Tenant isolation.** No tenant may read or write another tenant's data. Enforced by tenant filter in ORM + Postgres RLS + tests.

**BR-2 Manager transitivity.** For approvals, the direct manager approves. If the direct manager is out (marked "delegated") or missing, escalate to their manager, then Admin. MVP: only direct manager + Admin fallback. Delegation in Phase 2.

**BR-3 Balance immutability.** Balances are computed as `granted - used`. `used` = sum of APPROVED leave requests intersecting the current year. PENDING requests do NOT deduct from `remaining`, but the UI shows "future balance" = `remaining - sum(pending)` for the employee's own view.

**BR-4 No negative balance.** Booking rejected if `pending + requested > remaining`.

**BR-5 No carry-over.** On Dec 31 23:59 UTC (per tenant timezone), a snapshot of the year's usage is stored; on Jan 1 00:00, balances are re-granted per configured allowance. Unused days are lost.

**BR-6 Self-approval forbidden.** An employee cannot approve their own leave, even if they are also a Manager or Admin (Admin override still requires audit reason).

**BR-7 Duration in working days.** Sum of days between start and end (inclusive), minus weekends (per tenant), minus public holidays (per tenant), applying half-day adjustments.

**BR-8 Booking window.** Employees may book leave from today to today + 12 months. Historical booking (start_date < today) allowed only for Sick Leave (or leave types flagged `allowsBackdated=true`).

**BR-9 Cancellation.** PENDING cancellable anytime. APPROVED cancellable if start_date ≥ today + 1. Otherwise requires Admin.

**BR-10 Employee immutability by self.** Employees cannot edit hire_date, employment_status, department, manager, job_title, compensation, or bank_details of themselves via self-service (Admin only).

**BR-11 Termination cleanup.** On termination: revoke sessions, block login, cancel future leave requests, keep audit + records for retention period. Employee is soft-hidden from People directory (visible in Terminated filter).

**BR-12 Email uniqueness.** Email is unique per tenant, not globally. Two tenants may have same email address.

**BR-13 Slug immutability.** Tenant slug cannot change after creation (breaks bookmarks + email links).

**BR-14 Document types.** Only whitelisted MIME types accepted (PDF, PNG, JPG, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX). File extension AND magic-byte check.

## 12. Leave Management Rules — Detailed

### 12.1 Data model recap
- **LeaveType**: `id, tenant_id, name, icon, color, paid_boolean, allows_half_day, allows_backdated, requires_approval, default_annual_allowance, description, active`
- **LeavePolicy** (optional Phase 2): `id, tenant_id, leave_type_id, employment_type, annual_allowance` — overrides default per employment type.
- **LeaveBalance**: `id, tenant_id, employee_id, leave_type_id, year, granted (decimal), used (decimal)`. Refreshed on grant events.
- **LeaveRequest**: `id, tenant_id, employee_id, leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, start_half_day_pm, end_half_day_am, duration_days (decimal), status, note, submitted_at, decided_at, decider_id, decision_note`
- **PublicHoliday**: `id, tenant_id, date, name`
- **TenantConfig.weekend_days**: `Set<DayOfWeek>` (bitmap or serialized).

### 12.2 Grant rules
- **New tenant setup:** Admin creates leave types, sets annual allowance per type. Initial grant on activation for current year, pro-rated by months remaining.
- **New hire:** Balance = `annual_allowance * (months_remaining_in_year / 12)`, rounded to nearest 0.5. E.g., hired July 1 with 30-day annual → 15 days for that year.
- **Annual grant job:** Runs Jan 1 00:00 in tenant timezone. Creates fresh `LeaveBalance` row per (employee, leave_type, year). Emits audit entry.
- **Manual adjustment:** Admin can adjust `granted` on any employee's balance with a required reason. Recorded in audit.

### 12.3 Duration algorithm (pseudocode)
```
function computeDuration(start, end, startHalfPM, endHalfAM, weekend, holidays):
  days = 0.0
  for d in dateRange(start, end):
    if d in weekend or d in holidays: continue
    if d == start and d == end:
      // same-day
      if startHalfPM and endHalfAM: raise "invalid: half-day both AM and PM on same day"
      if startHalfPM: days += 0.5
      else if endHalfAM: days += 0.5
      else: days += 1.0
    else if d == start and startHalfPM: days += 0.5

    else: days += 1.0
  return days
```

### 12.4 Approval flow
1. Employee submits → status PENDING, `submitted_at = now`.
2. System identifies approver = employee.manager_id; if null → Admin(s) of tenant.
3. Approver receives email + "For action" inbox entry.
4. Approver clicks Approve/Reject with optional note → status APPROVED/REJECTED, `decided_at = now`, `decider_id = approver.id`.
5. Approved: `LeaveBalance.used += duration`. Rejected: no balance change.
6. Employee receives result email.
7. If auto-cancel (termination), status = CANCELLED with system note.

### 12.5 Configurability per tenant
- Leave types (unlimited).
- Annual allowance per type.
- Half-day allowed per type.
- Backdated booking allowed per type.
- Booking window (default 12 months forward).
- Weekend days.
- Public holidays (upload CSV or add one-by-one).

### 12.6 What we're NOT doing (explicit)
- No accrual (2.5/month). Full grant Jan 1.
- No carry-over.
- No encashment.
- No hourly leave.
- No compensatory off (accrual for weekend work). Phase 2+.
- No leave forfeiture on transfer (single tenant scope).

## 13. Organization Management

### 13.1 Structure
Two-level: **Division → Department**. Every Department has exactly one Division. Every active Employee has exactly one Department. Divisions and Departments are per-tenant.

### 13.2 Operations
- Admin creates Division (name, description).
- Admin creates Department (name, division_id, description, head_employee_id nullable).
- Rename allowed (audit-logged).
- Delete allowed only if no active employees and no historical assignments; otherwise soft-delete (marked `archived`).
- Reassign employees: bulk action to move employees from Dept A to Dept B.

### 13.3 Display
- People list shows Division + Department columns.
- Org chart view (Phase 2) renders tree of Divisions → Departments → Employees.

### 13.4 Migration path to N-level
Design the table with `parent_id` self-referencing on a unified `org_unit` table if we anticipate deeper hierarchies. For MVP, keep it as two explicit tables for clarity, but do NOT expose deeper API — makes future migration cleaner.

---

## 14. Employee Management — Detailed

### 14.1 Lifecycle states
`INVITED → ACTIVE → (ON_LEAVE) → TERMINATED`. `ON_LEAVE` is derived from having an active APPROVED leave that spans today.

### 14.2 Create employee (Admin flow)
1. Admin clicks "Add Employee".
2. Form: first name, last name, email, phone, hire date, employment type, department, job title, manager, working hours/day, currency, base compensation (optional).
3. On save: employee row created with status INVITED. Invite email sent with a one-time link (24h TTL). No password until invitee sets one.
4. Invitee accepts → sets password → status ACTIVE.

### 14.3 Edit employee
- Employee: can edit personal info, contact, address, emergency contacts, photo, upload documents.
- Manager: read-only on reports.
- Admin: everything, including job/compensation/employment status changes. History tables append.

### 14.4 Terminate
- Admin sets termination_date (past, today, or future).
- If today or past: status → TERMINATED immediately, session revoked, login blocked, future leave requests auto-cancelled.
- If future: scheduled job runs at midnight of termination date to apply above.
- Employee record retained (never deleted) — hidden from default People list, visible under filter "Terminated".

### 14.5 Custom fields (Phase 2)
Design DB with `employee_custom_field_definition` and `employee_custom_field_value` tables from day 1, but only expose UI in Phase 2. Avoids expensive migration later.

---

## 15. Department Management

Covered in §13. Additional detail:

- Department has one head (optional, chosen from active employees in that department).
- Department has a description (markdown, sanitized).
- Filter: "employees in this department" available on department detail page.
- API: `GET /divisions`, `GET /divisions/{id}/departments`, `POST/PATCH/DELETE /departments`.

---

## 16. Reporting

### 16.1 MVP reports

**Leave Balance (current year snapshot):**
- Columns: Employee, Department, Leave Type, Granted, Used, Remaining.
- Filters: department, division, leave type, employee status.
- Export: CSV, PDF (Phase 2).

**Leave Utilization (date range):**
- Columns: Employee, Leave Type, Days Used, Requests Count.
- Grouping: by Department, by Leave Type.
- Chart: stacked bar per department.
- Export: CSV.

**Headcount:**
- Chart: line of active employees over time (monthly).
- Filters: department, employment type.
- Export: CSV.

**Absence Calendar Export:**
- Month view PDF: rows = employees, columns = days, cell colored per leave type.
- CSV alternative for pipeline into other tools.

### 16.2 Phase 2: Custom Report Builder
- Entity picker: Employee, Leave Request.
- Column picker (multi-select).
- Filter builder (AND / OR groups, per-column operators).
- Group by + aggregate (count, sum, avg).
- Preview + save as named report + share within tenant (Admin only).

### 16.3 Implementation
- Reports run against read-only replicated view names to keep ORM out of the hot path? — Over-engineered for MVP. Use JPQL/JPA specifications + native SQL for aggregations. Cache results 60s.

---

## 17. Notifications

### 17.1 Channels (MVP)
- **Email** only, via SMTP.
- Templates in Thymeleaf, per-tenant branding (logo + primary color merged into HTML).
- SendGrid / Postmark / SES / any SMTP provider — configured per deployment.

### 17.2 Events
| Event | Recipients | Subject template |
|---|---|---|
| User invited | Invitee | "Welcome to {tenant} — set your password" |
| Password reset | User | "Reset your Helyx password" |
| Leave requested | Approver (manager + Admin fallback) | "{Employee} requested {Leave Type} — {duration}" |
| Leave approved | Employee | "Your {Leave Type} was approved" |
| Leave rejected | Employee | "Your {Leave Type} request was declined" |
| Leave cancelled by employee | Approver | "{Employee} cancelled their leave" |
| Document expiring | Employee + Admin | "{Document} expires in {N} days" |
| Public holiday tomorrow | All active users | "Reminder: {Holiday} tomorrow" |
| Birthday | Team members of celebrant | "🎂 It's {Employee}'s birthday today" (opt-in per tenant) |
| Work anniversary | Team | "🎉 {Employee} joined {tenant} {N} years ago today" (opt-in) |

### 17.3 Delivery
- Async via `@Async` + `TaskExecutor`, with a Postgres-backed outbox table (`email_outbox`) for retry + delivery audit.
- Scheduled retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then mark FAILED and log.
- Test SMTP via MailHog in dev.

### 17.4 Preferences (Phase 2)
- Per-user opt-in/out per category.
- Digest mode (daily summary).

---

## 18. Audit Logs — Detailed

### 18.1 What's captured

**Write audit** (`audit_entry` table):
- `id, tenant_id, actor_user_id, actor_role, occurred_at, entity_type, entity_id, action (CREATE|UPDATE|DELETE), before_json, after_json, ip, user_agent, request_id`.

**Login audit** (`login_audit` table):
- `id, tenant_id, user_id (nullable if unknown), occurred_at, email_attempted, success (bool), failure_reason (nullable), ip, user_agent, request_id`.

### 18.2 Implementation
- Hibernate `@EntityListeners` on all auditable entities → captures before/after in a `@PostPersist` / `@PreUpdate` / `@PreRemove`.
- Alternatively, Envers — but Envers is heavier and less flexible; roll our own for tighter control.
- MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) propagates request_id, actor, tenant across threads for correlated logs.
- Login events emitted from Spring Security `AuthenticationEventPublisher`.

### 18.3 UI (Admin only)
- Table: date, actor, entity, action, "view diff" (opens modal with before/after JSON).
- Filters: date range, actor, entity type, action.
- CSV export (Phase 2).

### 18.4 Retention
- Default 7 years (configurable per tenant).
- Nightly job archives entries > retention to cold storage (S3 Glacier) and deletes from Postgres. Phase 2.

---

## 19. Security Requirements

### 19.1 Authentication
- Passwords: BCrypt cost 12, min length 10, must have upper+lower+digit, blocked-common-passwords list.
- Reset tokens: 32-byte cryptographic random, single-use, 24h TTL, stored hashed.
- Session: JWT access token (15 min) + refresh token in HttpOnly SameSite=Lax secure cookie (7 days rolling). Session revocation via `token_revocation` table.
- Lockout: 5 failures / 15 min per (email + IP).
- MFA (TOTP): optional per user, enforceable per tenant for Admin role.

### 19.2 Authorization
- Every controller method annotated with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('...')")`.
- Row-level: enforced in ORM via tenant filter + additional per-entity ownership checks (e.g., leave request owner must be current user or their manager or Admin).
- Cross-tenant references impossible: any FK must resolve within `TenantContext`.

### 19.3 Transport
- HTTPS only. HSTS max-age 1 year with preload.
- HTTP → HTTPS 301.
- TLS 1.2+, modern ciphers only.

### 19.4 Data at rest
- Postgres data volume: LUKS-encrypted disk on VPS, or provider-managed encryption on cloud.
- Column-level encryption (AES-256-GCM) for `bank_details.*`, `government_id.number`, `compensation` (if tenant flag set). Key managed via env var / KMS.
- File storage: server-side encryption for S3; encrypted filesystem for local.

### 19.5 Input & output
- All input validated with Bean Validation (`@Valid`).
- All output HTML-escaped by Thymeleaf default (`th:text`).
- CSRF token on all state-changing forms (Spring Security default).
- SQL: only parameterized queries (JPA + JPQL + native prepared statements). No string concatenation.
- File upload: MIME + magic-byte check + extension whitelist + size limit + AV scan (ClamAV, optional per deployment).

### 19.6 Headers
- Content-Security-Policy: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net unpkg.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net; img-src 'self' data:; frame-ancestors 'none';` — refined per deployment.
- X-Frame-Options: DENY.
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin.
- Permissions-Policy: minimal.

### 19.7 Rate limiting
- Login endpoint: 10 req/min per IP.
- Password reset request: 3 req/hour per email.
- General API: 300 req/min per session.
- Implemented via Bucket4j (in-JVM) or Redis if multi-instance.

### 19.8 Backup
- Postgres: nightly `pg_dump` compressed → local + off-site (S3). Retained 30 days.
- Files: S3 versioning, or nightly rsync for local backend.
- Restore drill: quarterly.

### 19.9 Vulnerability management
- Dependabot on GitHub for library updates.
- OWASP Dependency-Check in CI.
- Snyk or Trivy scanning Docker image in CI.

### 19.10 Secrets
- Never in code. Loaded from env vars (12-factor). `.env.example` shipped, real `.env` in ops repo or Vault.

---

## 20. Multi-Tenancy Design

### 20.1 Chosen model
**Shared database, shared schema, `tenant_id` column on every row.**

### 20.2 Rationale
- Baseline scale (50 tenants × 50 employees = 2,500 employees total) fits comfortably in one Postgres instance.
- Single migration path (one Flyway history).
- Cheapest to operate, easiest to back up and monitor.
- Postgres RLS (Row-Level Security) available as second line of defense.

### 20.3 Tenant resolution
1. Request arrives at `mhz.helyx.app`.
2. `TenantResolutionFilter` (Spring Filter, first in chain) extracts subdomain, looks up tenant row by slug, and populates `TenantContext` (ThreadLocal → InheritableThreadLocal, plus contextual copy for reactive/async).
3. `TenantContext` cleared in `finally` block to prevent leak between requests.
4. If tenant not found → 404 with generic "Unknown tenant" page.
5. If tenant suspended → 503 page.

### 20.4 Enforcement (defense in depth)
1. **ORM restriction:** every tenant-aware entity's `tenant_id` field is annotated `@TenantId` (Hibernate discriminator multi-tenancy, Hibernate 7). Hibernate arms this restriction itself — from a `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver` bean (`TenantIdentifierResolver`) — on every query it generates for that entity, including `find(id)`; there is no hand-written `@Filter` and no AOP interceptor to opt it in per call (see ADR 0004).
2. **Auto-set on write:** Hibernate's own `@TenantId` column generation sets `tenant_id` from the same resolver on insert; no `@PrePersist` listener is involved.
3. **Postgres RLS:** per-table policy `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid)`. Set via `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id = ...` at the start of every transaction by `TenantSessionVariableListener` (a Spring `TransactionExecutionListener`, not an AOP aspect). This catches bugs independently of the ORM layer — including the (rare, deliberately audited) case where the ORM restriction is pointed at a placeholder tenant under `TenantContext.runAsSystem`.
4. **ArchUnit tests:** require every tenant-scoped entity to extend `common.TenantAwareEntity`; forbidding direct JDBC/native-query usage outside repositories is planned but not yet enforced (CLAUDE.md §8).
5. **Integration tests:** for every write path, assert audit log has correct `tenant_id`; for every read, seed 2 tenants and assert results are scoped.

### 20.5 Cross-tenant operations
Only Super Admin console (behind IP allowlist + separate authentication realm) may bypass filters, using explicit `TenantContext.runAsSystem(reason, action)`. Every call requires a reason string and is logged; all such bypasses audit-log with `SYSTEM` actor.

### 20.6 Backup & restore per tenant
- Full DB backup covers all tenants (single restore = all).
- Per-tenant restore requires custom script: `pg_dump --data-only --where "tenant_id='...'" per table`. Documented but not automated in MVP.

### 20.7 Suspension & deletion
- Suspend: set `tenant.suspended = true`. Filter in login flow rejects.
- Delete: 30-day soft-delete window (`tenant.deleted_at`), then cascade hard-delete via scheduled job that deletes rows per table where `tenant_id = ?`.

---

## 21. Database Schema (core tables)

Naming: snake_case, plural (Hibernate default). PKs are `uuid` v7 (time-ordered) for tenant-scoped tables — pluggable to `bigserial` if desired. Timestamps stored as `timestamptz` in UTC.

### 21.1 Migrations
- Flyway, one file per change, `V<yyyymmddhhmm>__<description>.sql`.
- Repeatable views/functions in `R__*.sql`.
- Never edit an applied migration; always add a new one.

Package cycle prevention: **ArchUnit** test forbids `people` from depending on `timeoff` (leaks) but allows `timeoff` to reference `people.Employee` by ID via a `PeopleFacade`.

## 23. API Design

REST + JSON, versioned under `/api/v1`. All endpoints tenant-scoped by subdomain. OpenAPI 3 auto-generated via springdoc, browsable at `/api/docs`.

### 23.1 Conventions
- Nouns, plural: `/employees`, `/leave-requests`.
- HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create/action), PATCH (partial update), PUT (rare), DELETE (soft).
- Filtering: query params (`?department=<id>&status=ACTIVE`).
- Pagination: `?page=0&size=20`; response wraps in `{content, page, size, totalElements, totalPages}`.
- Sorting: `?sort=lastName,asc`.
- Errors: RFC 7807 Problem Details.
- Auth: session cookie for web; Bearer token for API (Phase 2).

### 23.2 Key endpoints (MVP)

**Auth:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` → `{email, password}` → sets cookies
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` → `{email}`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password` → `{token, newPassword}`

- `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/verify`

**Employees:**
- `GET /api/v1/employees` (list, filters)
- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}`
- `POST /api/v1/employees` (Admin)
- `PATCH /api/v1/employees/{id}` (self limited; Admin full)
- `POST /api/v1/employees/{id}/terminate`
- `POST /api/v1/employees/{id}/reinvite`
- Sub-resources: `/education`, `/emergency-contacts`, `/government-ids`, `/bank-detail`, `/benefits`, `/documents`

**Organization:**
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/divisions`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/departments`

**Files:**
- `GET /api/v1/company-files`, `POST /api/v1/company-files` (Admin), `DELETE /api/v1/company-files/{id}` (Admin)
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/employees/{id}/documents`

**Calendar:**
- `GET /api/v1/calendar/team?from=&to=&departmentId=`
- `GET /api/v1/calendar/ical.ics?token=<user_token>` (public, no auth, per-user token)

**Reports:**
- `GET /api/v1/reports/leave-balance.csv?departmentId=`
- `GET /api/v1/reports/leave-utilization.csv?from=&to=&departmentId=`
- `GET /api/v1/reports/headcount.csv?from=&to=`

**Audit (Admin):**
- `GET /api/v1/audit?entityType=&actorId=&from=&to=&page=`
- `GET /api/v1/audit/logins?success=&from=&to=`

**Super Admin (separate host):**
- `POST /superadmin/tenants`
- `PATCH /superadmin/tenants/{id}/suspend`
- `DELETE /superadmin/tenants/{id}`

### 23.3 Error format (RFC 7807)
```json
{
  "type": "https://helyx.app/errors/insufficient-balance",
  "title": "Insufficient leave balance",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Requested 3 days but only 2 available for Vacation.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/leave-requests",
  "errorCode": "LEAVE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"
}
```

```

**Deployment topology (MHZ, on-prem Debian):**
- Single VPS. **PostgreSQL 17 installed natively** via `apt` on the host (not in a container — simpler backup, better perf, direct pg_dump). Docker Compose runs only 2 services: `helyx-app` (Spring Boot) and `caddy` (reverse proxy). The app container connects to the host Postgres via `host.docker.internal` or the Docker bridge gateway. LUKS-encrypted disk. Daily cron for `pg_dump`. `.env` for secrets (DB URL, credentials, encryption key, SMTP).

**Deployment topology (future cloud tenant):**
- Same Docker image. RDS/Cloud SQL for Postgres. S3 for files. Application Load Balancer with wildcard cert. Optional: run 2 app replicas + ShedLock for scheduler safety.

## 28. Future Enhancements (roadmap tail)

- SSO: Google, Microsoft, Apple, SAML.
- Custom domain per tenant (`hr.mhzgroup.com`).
- Attendance / clock-in-out with mobile app.
- Performance reviews module (OKRs, 1:1 notes, 360 reviews).
- Onboarding/offboarding checklist templates & workflow engine.
- Recruitment / ATS.
- Learning Management System.
- Payroll integration presets per country.
- Public REST API + tenant API keys.
- Webhooks (per-tenant configurable, e.g. leave.approved).
- Slack + MS Teams native apps.
- Multi-currency compensation with FX rates.
- Delegation ("I'm out — approve to X").
- Approval policies per leave type (single, dual, HR).
- Advanced org: N-level hierarchy, matrix orgs.
- AI-assisted policy Q&A (tenant handbook indexed).
- Skills & competencies catalog.
- Compensation planning module.
- Diversity & inclusion analytics.

## 29. Risks and Assumptions

### 29.1 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo developer bus factor | High | High | Externalize documentation, keep architecture simple, invest in tests, publish repo internally. |
| Tenant isolation bug leaks data | Low | Catastrophic | Defense in depth (filter + RLS + tests + code review). CI test suite fails on any cross-tenant read. |
| Scope creep from MHZ users after MVP | Medium | Medium | Enforce backlog + phases. Add "phase 3+" queue in issue tracker; require ROI note on every new request. |
| Grails-to-Spring learning curve | Medium | Low-Medium | Concepts map cleanly; budget 2 weeks of ramp before starting real features. Book: "Spring Boot in Action". |
| Free plan feature-parity moving target | Medium | Low | TalentHR could change features. Snapshot their free-plan spec now (screenshots + this PRD) and freeze scope. |
| Email deliverability | Medium | Medium | Start with provider (Postmark/SES) with SPF/DKIM/DMARC properly configured. Never send from generic Gmail. |
| Migration from TalentHR (data import) | Medium | Medium | Build CSV import for employees + leave balances first thing after core CRUD. |
| Losing data before backups exist | Medium | High | Set up nightly pg_dump before ANY real MHZ data enters system. Restore drill within first month. |
| Weak passwords on Admin accounts | Medium | High | Enforce MFA for Admins from Phase 1.5. |
| Time zone bugs in leave duration | High (bug type) | Medium | Store all timestamps UTC; do all date math in tenant timezone; unit-test around DST, year boundary, week boundary. |
| PDF/CSV report scale | Low | Low | For MVP volumes, materialized-view + Postgres is fine. Revisit if a tenant grows past 1000 employees. |
| Legal/labor-law compliance per region | Medium | Medium | We're region-agnostic by design. Explicit "you are responsible for policy compliance" clause in ToS. |
| GDPR data-subject requests | Low (no EU tenants yet) | Medium | Design "export my data" endpoint from day 1 even if UI is Phase 2. |

### 29.2 Assumptions

- MHZ has fewer than 20 employees for at least 12 months → single Spring Boot instance handles it trivially.
- No hard SLA to external customers in year 1 (MHZ only + friendly pilots).
- English UI is acceptable for launch even for UAE (Arabic in Phase 2).
- Weekend definition is uniform across the whole tenant (no per-employee weekends).
- Manager is a single person (no dotted-line matrix in MVP).
- One year = Jan 1–Dec 31 for balance grants (no fiscal-year offset in MVP).
- Employees have a valid email address (required, unique per tenant).
- No physical time-clock integration in MVP.
- Tenant sub-domain DNS is manageable by us (wildcard *.helyx.app).
- All tenants trust Helyx-provided storage; nobody insists on their own S3 bucket in MVP.
- MHZ can provide test data and act as design partner.
- Spring Boot 4.1.0 remains stable through the MVP build cycle (released June 2026, LTS-track).
