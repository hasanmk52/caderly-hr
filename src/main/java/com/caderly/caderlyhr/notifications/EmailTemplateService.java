/**
 * Renders one email body from {@code templates/email/} (PRD §17.1, FR-9.1).
 *
 * <p>Rendering happens at <em>enqueue</em> time and the finished HTML is stored on the outbox row,
 * so {@code EmailDispatcher} and {@code EmailDelivery} are untouched by this phase: the dispatcher
 * still sends {@code body_html} verbatim. That also means a template edit never retroactively
 * rewrites mail that was already decided on — the row records what we said we would send.
 *
 * <p>Reuses the application's own {@code SpringTemplateEngine} rather than standing up a second
 * one. Its resolver prefix is already {@code classpath:/templates/}, and Boot has already wired the
 * app {@code MessageSource} into it, so {@code #{...}} resolves in an email exactly as it does in a
 * page (ADR 0013).
 *
 * <p><strong>Email templates must not use {@code @{...}} link expressions.</strong> A plain {@link
 * Context} is not an {@code IWebContext} — there is no request to build a URL against, and by
 * design: mail is enqueued on a request thread today but on a scheduler thread for the reminder
 * events. Absolute URLs come in as model attributes instead.
